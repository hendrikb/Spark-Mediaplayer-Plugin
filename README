As You can see, this is a VERY EARLY version of this plugin


== INSTALLATION ==

 Compile against a current spark source code or jar, basically it's a great idea to ..
 1st check out the spark source code (see link above)
 2nd put this projects checkout into spark_dir/src/plugins/mediaplayer
 3nd (it's also great if you got Apache ANT installed), go to spark_dir/build/
 	and enter "ant" to compile
 4th go to spark_dir/src/plugins/mediaplayer/build/ and also compile here with "ant"
 5th start spark
 
 
 You can also modify the build.plugins target in the ant script spark_dir/build/build.xml
 to let ant compile Spark's source code plus the mediaplayer plugin (step 3 + step 4) in
 one step.
 
 I'll probably provide a current jar in the near future.
