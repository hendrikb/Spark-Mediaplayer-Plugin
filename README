== INFO == 

This is the SPARK MEDIAPLAYER PLUGIN for the XMPP client Spark. 

Additional information on Spark can be found at: 
http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/spark/index.jsp 

CURRENTLY SUPPORTED MEDIAPLAYERS: * iTunes Windows & iTunes Mac (tested 
as of Nov'11) * ... more to come. CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES: * "now 
playing"-button in the ChatBox will paste current song playing if you 
use iTunes (Win & Mac) 

As You can see, this is a VERY EARLY version of this plugin 


== INSTALLATION == 

Compile against a current spark source code or jar, basically it's a 
great idea to ..
1st check out the spark source code (see link above)
2nd put this projects checkout into spark_dir/src/plugins/mediaplayer
3nd (it's also great if you got Apache ANT installed), go to 
	spark_dir/build/ and enter "ant" to compile
4th go to spark_dir/src/plugins/mediaplayer/build/ and also compile here
with "ant"
5th start spark You can also modify the build.plugins target in the ant
script spark_dir/build/build.xml to let ant compile Spark's source code
plus the mediaplayer plugin (step 3 + step 4) in one step. I'll probably
provide a current jar in the near future.
